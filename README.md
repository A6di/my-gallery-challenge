# my-gallery-challenge

Create a static page with HTML and CSS following the designs. You can give it your personal styles by using different images or text.

- What was your experience?
- What have you learned/improved?

I learn a lot more about using grid - as I have mostly used flexbox.

I have finally done a static page on my own. Now I have to just keep going.
